### Password Manager   

#### **Introduction**  
The **Password Manager** is a console-based application designed to securely store and manage passwords. By leveraging the **SHA-256 hashing algorithm**, it ensures that sensitive password data is stored in an unreadable format, providing an added layer of security. The application also utilizes a **HashMap** to organize and access password records quickly and efficiently. This tool is simple to use, making it accessible to anyone, whether they are looking to manage their passwords securely or learn about secure programming practices.

#### **Features and Capabilities**  
The Password Manager offers the following functionalities:  

1. **Add Passwords**:  
   - Users can save passwords associated with specific accounts or services.  
   - The application stores only the hashed version of the password using the SHA-256 algorithm.  

2. **View Password Records**:  
   - Users can view the stored account names or services for which passwords have been saved.  
   - Actual passwords are never displayed for security reasons.  

3. **Delete Password Records**:  
   - Allows users to delete stored password records if they are no longer needed.  

4. **Secure Storage**:  
   - By using SHA-256 hashing, the application ensures that stored passwords cannot be reverse-engineered or read, even if the data is compromised.  

5. **Efficient Management**:  
   - Uses a HashMap to ensure fast organization and retrieval of password records.
